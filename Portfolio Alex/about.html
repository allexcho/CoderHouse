      <h1 class="about">Let me introduce myself.</h1>
      <p class="description">
        Born and raised in New York City and currently based in Argentina, I am
        a dedicated and proactive professional with a robust background in
        customer service and administration. Currently, I serve as the General
        Manager at a local clothing shop, where I have honed my skills in team
        management, customer relations, and operational oversight.
      </p>
      <p class="description1">
        Having transitioned into the tech industry, I recently completed a
        comprehensive Full Stack development course followed by specialized
        training in Front End development. My passion for technology and design
        drives my career ambition to become a skilled Front End Software
        Engineer. I am committed to continuous learning and am eager to apply my
        coding skills in a dynamic and innovative environment. Fluent in both
        English and Spanish, I am ready to contribute to and grow with a global
        team.
